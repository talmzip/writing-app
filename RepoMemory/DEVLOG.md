# Dev Log

## 2026-03-16 — Transition fixes, zoom fix, reading mode improvements
- Reverted compensatingScale/CSS-scale zoom to proven per-frame font-size lerp — CSS scale from origin 0,0 caused position jumps
- Phased writing→reading transition: viewport expands first (text stays in place), then text slides to reading position, then switch to native scroll
- Improved reading→writing: converts scroll position to offset accurately, cursor appears with 250ms delay (keyboard settles first)
- Made gesture recognizer touchstart passive — fixes scroll jank in reading mode
- Added `user-select: none` on text-world — prevents text selection without needing preventDefault
- Added top padding (5vh) in reading mode for breathing room
- Added Transitions section to WritingAppDesign.md (user-facing descriptions)

## 2026-03-16 — Module split + smoothness refactor (Phase 1+2)
- Split monolithic `script.js` (988 lines) into 8 ES modules under `src/`
- New AnimationLoop class: central rAF with named registered tick functions, auto-stops when all settled
- New GestureRecognizer class: classifies touch/click, fires callbacks (no preventDefault — consumer decides)
- New ModeManager state machine: prompt→writing↔reading, owns all DOM state per mode, wires gestures per mode
- Incremental DOM rendering (Phase 2B): only inserts new locked line divs + updates active line — falls back to full rebuild on boundary invalidation
- Unified animation loop (Phase 2C): zoom, stretch, scroll, viewport, fade all as registered tick functions
- `index.html` now uses `<script type="module" src="src/main.js">`

## 2026-03-15 — Reading/writing mode transitions fixed, design doc + implementation plan

- Fixed reading→writing mode re-entry bug (handleResize checked _readingModeBlocked after heightGrew — reordered)
- Fixed tap detection on mobile (distance < 15px + time < 300ms thresholds)
- Fixed scroll stuck at top (overscroll bounce triggering false taps)
- Fixed viewport height snapping (removed forced snaps, let animation loop converge naturally)
- Moved `touch-action: none` from global `html, body` to `#viewport` only, toggled per mode
- Increased ZOOM_LERP to 0.13, scroll lerp to 0.22 for more visible smooth animations
- Rewrote `WritingAppDesign.md` — added Highlights, Zen Mode, Type-to-Navigate, updated Gap, Core Principles, Architecture
- Created `ImplementationPlan.md` — 6-phase plan, module structure, architecture review, cross-platform strategy, non-developer explanation

## 2026-03-15 — Rendering engine refactor: removed CSS scale()
- Replaced CSS `transform: scale()` with actual visual font size rendering
- Text now rendered at `BASE_FONT_SIZE * currentScale` — browser sees real dimensions
- Removed all `scale()` from CSS transforms; only `translateY` (and `translateX` for RTL) remain
- Letter-spacing, squeeze, fade, cursor all use visual dimensions (charW * scale, lineH * scale)
- Cursor width now scales proportionally (min 1.5px)
- Text-world width set to viewport width (was viewportW / scaleEnd for scale compensation)
- Reading mode: native browser scroll (overflow-y: auto) replaces manual touch scroll
- Removed: readingScrollY, readingTouchStartY, readingScrollVelocity, readingScale, applyReadingTransform, clampReadingScroll, startReadingMomentum, wheel handler
- Touch handlers simplified: writing mode = focus, reading mode = tap (no drag) to exit

## 2026-03-15 — Centered cursor start, responsive zoom, smooth keyboard transition
- Cursor starts at vertical center (0.5) and interpolates to lower third (2/3) as writing progresses
- Text-world pushed down via positive translateY so cursor sits mid-screen early on; as lines fill upward toward top edge, clamp kicks in and normal scrolling begins
- Responsive ZOOM_END_CHARS: scales by viewport area ratio vs desktop reference (1920x1080), clamped to 0.4-1.0x. Smaller screens get larger max-zoom text
- Smooth keyboard transitions: renderedViewportH lerps toward actual viewportH (factor 0.15). Height-only resizes (keyboard) animate; width changes (orientation) snap immediately
- Replaced momentum-based zoom (velocity + decay, caused oscillation) with simple lerp (factor 0.08)
- Stretch lerp slowed to 0.008 (~2-3s settle) for subtlety

## 2026-03-15 — Prompt overlay, enter line behavior, stretch animation
- Added "what's on your mind?" prompt overlay — italic, gray, centered. Tap anywhere to dismiss, focus textarea, show cursor. Solves mobile keyboard activation via user gesture.
- Enter-created lines (hasNewline) no longer stretch to fill viewport — kept at 0 letter-spacing to visually mark intentional line breaks.
- Stretch uses per-line currentSpacing that lerps toward target (computed from currentScale each frame). Locked lines start at their active-line spacing and slowly expand.
- Space-triggered line drop: fires when line has ≥ cpl-1 chars (unsqueezed capacity).
- Removed `autofocus` attribute from hidden textarea.

## 2026-03-14 — Graduated stretch + mobile keyboard
- Changed from uniform to graduated per-line stretch based on birth scale
- Active line always has 0 letter-spacing; older lines stretch more
- Graduated factor blends to uniform at max zoom
- Removed separate stretch animation — derived from scale each frame
- Added autofocus + document touchstart focus for mobile keyboard

## 2026-03-14 — Line locking + stretch mechanism
- Resolved text width vs. line stability challenge
- Each line is now a separate `<div class="line">` that locks permanently once the next line begins
- Added global `letter-spacing` stretch computed from current scale: `charW × (scaleStart/S − 1)`
- Scale and stretch both animate via momentum (velocity + decay) in a combined rAF loop
- Removed dynamic text-world width — now fixed at max stretch width
- Added dev toggle (Ctrl+Shift+J) for two line-break modes: Justified Flow and Natural Flow
- CSS: removed `white-space: pre-wrap` and `word-break: break-all` from `#text-display`, added `.line { white-space: pre }`

## 2026-03-13 — Momentum animations, RTL fix, responsive width fix
- Added momentum-based zoom and fade animations
- Fixed RTL positioning with translateX
- Fixed text overflow with dynamic text-world width (now superseded by line locking)

## 2026-03-11 — Continuous zoom + rectangle text
- Replaced staged zoom with continuous per-character zoom
- Changed to `word-break: break-all` for dense rectangle

## 2026-03-11 — Phase 1 implementation
- Complete rewrite: hidden textarea input, CSS transform zoom, cursor positioning, fade overlay, session autosave, sessions viewer, RTL support
